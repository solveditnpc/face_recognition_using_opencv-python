# Face Recognition Attendance System

A simple and efficient face recognition attendance system using OpenCV and Python. The system stores attendance records in CSV format, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Automated attendance marking
- User-friendly GUI interface
- CSV export functionality for attendance records
- Multiple face recognition support
- High accuracy using deep learning models
- Attendance history tracking
- Easy user registration system
- Unrecognized faces storage in `unknown_faces` folder
- Anti-spoofing measures
- Detailed logging system

## Installation Guide

### Windows Installation

1. Install Python (3.8 or higher):
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools (required for dlib):
   - Download Visual Studio Build Tools from [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
   - Install "Desktop development with C++"

3. Install all required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Linux Installation

1. Install system dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip build-essential cmake libopencv-dev python3-opencv python3-numpy
   ```

2. Install Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py   # On Windows
   python3 main.py  # On Linux
   ```

2. The system will:
   - Detect faces through your camera
   - Recognize registered individuals
   - Store attendance in CSV format
   - Save unrecognized faces in the `unknown_faces` folder for later review

## Note

- Ensure good lighting conditions for better face recognition
- Keep the camera stable for accurate results
- Make sure to register faces before attempting recognition
- Check the `unknown_faces` folder periodically to review and potentially register new faces
- The system automatically creates the `unknown_faces` folder if it doesn't exist
